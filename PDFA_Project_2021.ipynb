    "For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of\n",
    "your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is\n",
    "of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data\n",
    "related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.\n",
    "We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.\n",
    "Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",

    "Despite the impact of COVID-19 property prices in Ireland continue to increase year on year. In fact, latest research by Dermot O’Leary of Goodbody precict that house prices are expected to rise by 12.5% in 2021, 5% in 2022 and 4% in 2023 ([1](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/average-irish-home-buyer-will-need-90-000-income-by-2023-1.4714161)). Further analysis provided by the Central Statistics Office of Ireland show that the Residential Property Index has increased by 104.4% for areas outside of Dublin since the low point in May 2013 ([2](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-rppi/residentialpropertypriceindexaugust2021/))\n",

    "As a married couple who is looking to get on the property ladder here in Letterkenny, County Donegal, this increase in house price index is alarming to say the least. As more companies offer their employees the opportunity to work from home, we have seen an influx of people from outside the county moving here to avail of the lower protperty prices. In a report published in September 2021 it was noted that the increase in house prices in Donegal was the second highest in the country at 8.4%.

    "### Dataset to Simulate\n",
    "\n",
    "For this simulation project I have decided to investgate the selling prices of houses in Letterkenny, County Donegal over the past three years. In order to investgate the variables involved, their likely distributiona and their relationships with each other I have scraped data from the daft.ie website.\n",
    "From the daft.ie webiste we can get an overview of the company and their prevalence in the Irish housing market ([4](https://support.daft.ie/hc/en-ie/articles/360007696318-About)):\n",
    ">Founded in 1997 by brothers Eamonn and Brian Fallon, Daft.ie is focused on empowering users to make informed decisions through a mixture of innovative product features and in-depth quarterly market analysis by way of Ireland's most read property report - The Daft Report.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Daft.ie is the number one destination for property searchers and connects property professionals with a unique audience of over 2.5 million users each month. Today, Daft.ie is part of Distilled SCH - the leader in online marketplaces in Ireland.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create my initial dataset I investgated the daft.ie Price Register Index. Here Daft.ie maintains a registry which augments the data kept by the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) in their Residential Property Price Register. While the official Residential Property Price Register only records the Date of Sale, Price and Address of all residential properties purchased in Ireland since the 1st January 2010, Daft.ie also records the number of bedrooms and bathrooms for each of the properties that they have sold.\n",

    "Using the Daft.ie Property Price Register website (available at: https://ww1.daft.ie/price-register/?d_rd=1). I searched for all properties sold in Letterkenny, County Donegal with at least 1 bedoom listed:\n",

    "I was then able to copy all the data from the website and manually paste it into a .csv file. With the data collected from 2018 - 2021 I then parsed the data using Microsoft Excel to split the single text field into individual fields representing:\n",
